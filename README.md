# Analyses and Predictive Modelling of  Global Terrorism Attack success or failure 
The primary objective of this project is to anlayze global terrorism trends draw insightful conclusions from the data on terrorist attack patterns and build a predictive model that will predict the probability of success or failure of terrorist attacks.

The model utilize historical data on previous attacks, which include factors such as

country, city, region, attack type,
weapon type, target type, attack duration greater than 24 hours or less,
whether a kid was held hostage, group name,
and if the attack was single or multiple.
to identify patterns which determines which attack is most likely to be succesful and thus advice on necessary action to take.

The Global Terrorism Dataset is gotten from Kaggle, it contains terrorism incident in the world from 2013 to 2017,
